### ResXpress

This file contains multiple examples of resXpress usage.

###################################################################################
Case 1: I already have a record in English .resx file and now I want to add 
corresponding records to Norwegian and Swedish .resx files.

Syntax:
EN: Some record I already had
NO: En rekord jeg allerede hadde
SE: Något rekord hade jag redan

Note: ResXpress will find first record with "Some record I already had" in 
English .resx and use its key to create corresponding records in other files.

###################################################################################
Case 2: I want to create completely new record in English and Finnish .resx files.

Syntax:
key: keyForMyNewRecord
EN: Wow! I created new record.
FI: Vau! Tein uuden ennätyksen.

Note: Here, providing key is necessary since there are no corresponding records
from which resXpress could resolve key value.

###################################################################################
Case 3: I already have English record and want to update Norwegian one.

Syntax:
key: someRecordToUpdate
NO: Oppdatert rekordverdi

or

Syntax:
EN: English value of record I want to update
NO: Oppdatert rekordverdi

Note: During update, resXpress can resolve corresponding record key using both key
and other language's corresponding values.

###################################################################################
Case 4: I want to do multiple updates and/or additions to my .resx files

Syntax:
EN: First record I want to update
NO: Første post jeg vil oppdatere

key: someRecordIWantToAdd
EN: Freshly created record

EN: Second record I want to update
NO: Andre rekord jeg ønsker å oppdatere

Note: You can instruct resXpress to modify multiple records at once. In case of
conflicts (modyfing same record twice), last instruction takes precedence.

Another note: Typically, you want to use new lines to separate different
instructions for resXpress. However, it's usually not necessary to do so.
ResXpress will detect new instruction start if it will start with directive
in language that previous record already included.

For example:
EN: First record I want to update
NO: Første post jeg vil oppdatere
EN: Second record I want to update
NO: Andre rekord jeg ønsker å oppdatere

will be recognized identically to example in Case 4, since when second "EN"
directive occurs, extension already processed "EN" directive for first record.
